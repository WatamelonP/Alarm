# YOUR PROJECT TITLE
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: This is a Chrome extension where it plays a sound on a loop every time the user opens a tab that can serve as a distraction. The user can designate a URL as a distraction by adding the link as a bookmark inside the automatically generated bookmarks tab. This is an extension that only works if the user wants to help themself.



#### known issues:
#### CTRL + shift + t to reopen a disruptive tab triggers the same event multiple times. 
#### popup.html wont work as intended.


#### Credits:
#### Honkai Star Rail's Herta and The Herta ingame voicelines, and sticker.
#### I cant find the original edit of the alarm sound. mightve been deleted or privated in youtube.

#### Tools used:
#### GPT: mainly for catching errors and fixing wrong syntax. most of the codes i used are from me piecing things together from other repositories such as the ones above.
#### Lottie: Used this to animate the sticker i used.


#### Comments:
#### Error handling in javascript is such a pain. i cant even tell if im doing something wrong even though it's working. Wouldve never thought the things i originally wanted to  do wasnt possible to do due to restrictions. 
#### The project ended a lot faster because the things i wanted to implement are actually easy to implement thanks to google. 
#### The important functions of this extension is just reading and loading of the bookmarks folder, reading the current open tabs, and generating a bookmarks folder(didnt think this was possible to be honest. i thought this would be restricted.)

#### The character i used is The Herta from Honkai StarRail. As for why i used her, it's because i thought it would suit her character pretty well. I initially wanted to make a more professional extension, one without such characters, and simply use a loud alarm sound, but i thought that would be boring, so i changed it midway.
