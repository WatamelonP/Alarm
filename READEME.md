#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: This is a Chrome extension where it plays a sound on a loop every time the user opens a tab that can serve as a distraction. The user can designate a URL as a distraction by adding the link as a bookmark inside the automatically generated bookmarks tab. This is an extension that only works if the user wants to help themself.



#### known issues:
#### CTRL + shift + t to reopen a disruptive tab triggers the same event multiple times. 
#### popup.html wont work as intended.


#### Credits:
#### Honkai Star Rail's Herta and The Herta ingame voicelines, and sticker.
#### I cant find the original edit of the alarm sound. mightve been deleted or privated in youtube.
